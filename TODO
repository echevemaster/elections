Things that need doing to get this deployed
===========================================

* Write a conversion script for the old db model to the new one
* rpmify
* rpmify flask-fas (or get flask-fas into python-fedora)
* Implement a voting method for range voting

* CSRF protection -- anything going through wtf forms is protected.  It's up to
  us to make sure that no data changing requests are coded without wtf forms.
  So this is really: audit to make sure everything is using wtf forms

* Error handling -- unknown elections, etc

Future enhancements (anything not necessary for deploying)
==========================================================

* Make voting methods modular
* Give this a Fedora theme
* Break the main program logic out into library modules
** Controllers should be as lightweight as possible
*** validation of input
**** Might decorate the controller method but the validation itself should live
     in another module.  Might want to break validation schemas into another
     module too
*** Authentication
**** decorators can go here and calls that return True or False.  Logic itself
     should go in a different module
*** return data to templating engine
*** Association with a URL
* i18n.  Need review: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=839071
** mark strings
** Pull translatable strings out
** set up transifex
